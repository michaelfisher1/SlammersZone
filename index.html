       		<p><main>Hello there! Thank you for visiting. This is a quick explanation of who I am to practice building a website. This website will serve as a basic template to test new skills and abilities in website design and will evolve over the course of the year. Chances are it will look pretty <span class="bad">terrible</span> with mismatched colours and ill advised design choices, but that's ok! Although the aesthetics may be a bit out of wack the structure and logic of the website will be sound.</main></p>
