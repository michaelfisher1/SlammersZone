<h2>Volleyball Overview</h2>
<p>To put it simply, volleyball is a team sport where two teams battle it out on a court divided by a net. The sport originated in the United States, and it has now gained attention on a global scale. It currently ranks only behind soccer among participation sports.</p>
        <p>Volleyball is currently played by 800 million people at least once a week worldwide, and its popularity is attributed to a number of factors. Volleyball is safe, fun and does not require extreme levels of fitness to participate. It is great for people who want a low-impact sport to get fit without pushing them to their limits. However, for those who have a competitive streak the sport can provide an exciting, intense environemnt while seperating you from your opponents with the net.
        <p>Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, men and women alike, and is great for a family environemnt. Anyone considering starting a new sport or excerise program should see their doctor first.
<h3>Volleyball Rules</h3>
<p>The object of the game is for each team to send the ball regularly over the net to ground it on the opponent's court, and to prevent the ball from being grounded on its own court. The ball is put into play by the right back-row player who serves the ball by hitting it over the net to the opponent's court. A team is allowed to hit the ball three times (in addition to the block contact) to return it to the opponent's court. A player is not allowed to hit the ball twice consecutively, except when attempting a block. The ralley (sequence of each team hitting the ball) until the ball touches the ground/floor, goes "out" or a team fails to return it to the opponent's court or commits a fault.</p>
<p>The team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). When the receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its players rotate one position clockwise. The best of three or best of five games will win matches. Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap). If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 ponts with a two-point advantage (also no scoring cap). </p>
