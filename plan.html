<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<p><strong>Name: </strong> Michael Fisher</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of this website is to increase the number of participants at Slammers volleyball arena and awareness of their establishment. They currently have approximately 100 people per week but would like to see a 50% increase in players and spectators.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Slammers is expecting a 50% percent increase in customer participation at their arena. Success would be measured by an increase in team registrations, competition signups, function hirings, seats filled during competitions, and sales at the bar. These statistics will be measured against their recorded values before the site was launched.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Slammers has a current audience of young adults and mature adults, ages 35-50. They would like to appeal to a younger audience (specifically high school age - 30 years old) with an emphasis on family participation. Family participation will be promoted by emphasising the 4-a-side tournament. Slammers has the facilities to organise school functions as a way to allow high school students to compete against themselves. Bold colours, use of dynamic photos, and an emphasis on competition will all go towards appealing to a younger audience.</p>
